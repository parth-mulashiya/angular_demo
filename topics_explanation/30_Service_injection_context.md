# Service Injection Context in Angular

Service Injection Context in Angular is an important concept that relates to how and where services are provided and injected within an application. Understanding this context is crucial for managing the lifecycle and scope of services effectively.

### 1. Hierarchical Dependency Injection

Angular uses a hierarchical dependency injection system. This means that injectors are organized in a tree structure that parallels the component tree. When a component requests a dependency, Angular looks for the dependency in its own injector. If not found, it passes the request up to its parent component's injector, and so on, until it reaches the root injector.

### 2. Injection Contexts

There are several levels at which you can provide services in Angular:

a) Root level (Application-wide singleton)
b) Module level
c) Component level
d) Element level (for directives)

### 3. Root Level Injection

When you provide a service at the root level, it creates a single, shared instance of the service that's available application-wide.

```typescript
@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class GlobalService {
  // ...
}
```

This is equivalent to adding the service to the providers array of the AppModule:

```typescript
@NgModule({
  // ...
  providers: [GlobalService]
})
export class AppModule { }
```

### 4. Module Level Injection

Services can be provided at the module level. This creates a new instance of the service for all components within that module.

```typescript
@NgModule({
  // ...
  providers: [ModuleLevelService]
})
export class FeatureModule { }
```

### 5. Component Level Injection

You can provide a service in the `providers` array of a component. This creates a new instance of the service for that component and all its child components.

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-my-component',
  template: '...',
  providers: [ComponentLevelService]
})
export class MyComponent {
  constructor(private service: ComponentLevelService) {}
}
```

### 6. Element Level Injection (for Directives)

For directives, you can specify a provider at the element level:

```typescript
@Directive({
  selector: '[appMyDirective]',
  providers: [DirectiveLevelService]
})
export class MyDirective {
  constructor(private service: DirectiveLevelService) {}
}
```

### 7. Resolution Modifiers

Angular provides resolution modifiers that can change how dependency resolution works:

a) @Optional(): Allows Angular to consider a service as optional. If not found, it injects null instead of throwing an error.

b) @Self(): Restricts the dependency resolution to the component's own injector.

c) @SkipSelf(): Starts the dependency resolution from the parent injector, skipping the component's own injector.

d) @Host(): Stops the upward resolution at the host component.

Example:

```typescript
@Component({
  // ...
})
export class MyComponent {
  constructor(
    @Optional() private optionalService: OptionalService,
    @Self() private selfService: SelfService,
    @SkipSelf() private parentService: ParentService,
    @Host() private hostService: HostService
  ) {}
}
```

### 8. forRoot() and forChild() Pattern

For feature modules that you intend to import into other modules, you might use the forRoot() and forChild() pattern:

```typescript
@NgModule({
  // ...
})
export class MyFeatureModule {
  static forRoot(): ModuleWithProviders<MyFeatureModule> {
    return {
      ngModule: MyFeatureModule,
      providers: [MyFeatureService]
    };
  }

  static forChild(): ModuleWithProviders<MyFeatureModule> {
    return {
      ngModule: MyFeatureModule,
      providers: []
    };
  }
}
```

This pattern allows you to control whether the services should be provided once for the entire app (forRoot) or multiple times for lazy-loaded modules (forChild).

### 9. Injection Context and Lazy Loading

When you use lazy loading in Angular, each lazy-loaded module gets its own child injector. This means that if you provide a service in a lazy-loaded module, it will have its own instance of that service, separate from the root or other modules.

### 10. View Providers

In some cases, you might want to limit the visibility of a service to just the view of a component, excluding content children. You can use `viewProviders` for this:

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-my-component',
  template: '...',
  viewProviders: [ViewLevelService]
})
export class MyComponent {
  constructor(private service: ViewLevelService) {}
}
```

Understanding these different injection contexts allows you to control the scope and lifetime of your services effectively, leading to more efficient and maintainable Angular applications.
