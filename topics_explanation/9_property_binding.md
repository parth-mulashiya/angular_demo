Property binding is a crucial feature in Angular that allows you to set properties of DOM elements or directives. Let's dive deep into the details of property binding:

1. Basic Syntax:
   [property]="expression"

   Where 'property' is the target property and 'expression' is a template expression that Angular evaluates.

2. Purpose:
   - To set properties of target elements or directives dynamically.
   - To pass data from a parent component to a child component.

3. Direction:
   One-way binding from the component to the view (component -> view).

4. Examples:

   a) Basic property binding:
      ```html
      <img [src]="imageUrl">
      <button [disabled]="!isEnabled">Click me</button>
      ```

   b) Binding to a component property:
      ```html
      <app-child [childProperty]="parentProperty"></app-child>
      ```

5. Property vs Attribute:
   Property binding sets the property of the DOM element, not the attribute.
   
   Example:
   ```html
   <!-- This sets the DOM property, not the attribute -->
   <input [value]="userName">
   
   <!-- This sets the attribute, not the property -->
   <input attr.value="{{userName}}">
   ```

6. Attribute Binding:
   If you need to set an attribute rather than a property, use attr. prefix:
   ```html
   <td [attr.colspan]="colSpan">Content</td>
   ```

7. Boolean Properties:
   For boolean properties, Angular treats `false` and `null` as `false`, all other values as `true`.
   ```html
   <button [disabled]="isDisabled">Click me</button>
   ```

8. Class Binding:
   A special form of property binding for setting classes:
   ```html
   <div [class.active]="isActive">Content</div>
   ```

9. Style Binding:
   Another special form for setting inline styles:
   ```html
   <div [style.color]="textColor" [style.font-size.px]="fontSize">Styled text</div>
   ```

10. Binding to Non-String Properties:
    Angular automatically coerces string values to the expected property type:
    ```html
    <app-item [itemId]="'42'"></app-item>
    ```
    If `itemId` is a number, Angular will convert '42' to 42.

11. Using Expressions:
    You can use complex expressions in property binding:
    ```html
    <p [textContent]="'Current count: ' + count"></p>
    ```

12. Binding to Directive Inputs:
    Property binding is used to pass data to directive inputs:
    ```html
    <div [ngClass]="{'active': isActive, 'disabled': isDisabled}">Content</div>
    ```

13. Escaping Square Brackets:
    If the property name itself contains square brackets, you can escape them:
    ```html
    <app-item [someProp]="value"></app-item>
    <app-item bind-someProp="value"></app-item> <!-- Alternative syntax -->
    ```

14. One-time Binding:
    Angular doesn't have built-in one-time binding, but you can achieve similar results:
    ```html
    <div [attr.data-value]="initialValue">...</div>
    ```

15. Security Considerations:
    Angular sanitizes and escapes values to prevent XSS attacks. For trusted content, you can use bypass security:
    ```typescript
    import { DomSanitizer } from '@angular/platform-browser';
    
    constructor(private sanitizer: DomSanitizer) {}
    
    trustHtml() {
      return this.sanitizer.bypassSecurityTrustHtml('<script>alert("XSS")</script>');
    }
    ```
    ```html
    <div [innerHTML]="trustHtml()"></div>
    ```

16. Performance Considerations:
    - Angular checks bound properties on every change detection cycle.
    - For better performance, use `OnPush` change detection strategy when possible.

17. Debugging:
    You can use template reference variables to inspect bound values:
    ```html
    <img [src]="imageUrl" #img>
    <p>{{img.src}}</p>
    ```

18. Common Pitfalls:
    - Forgetting square brackets (results in string interpolation instead of property binding).
    - Using property binding when attribute binding is needed (e.g., with `colspan`).
    - Not handling null or undefined values properly.

Property binding is a powerful feature in Angular that allows for dynamic, responsive user interfaces. Understanding its nuances and best practices is crucial for effective Angular development.
