The difference between Property Binding and String Interpolation in Angular.

1. String Interpolation:

String Interpolation is a one-way data binding technique that uses the double curly braces {{ }} to display data from the component class in the template. It's used to embed expressions into marked up text.

Key points:
- Syntax: {{ expression }}
- Direction: Component to view (one-way)
- Usage: Primarily used for outputting strings in the template

Example:
```html
<p>Hello, {{ username }}!</p>
```

In this case, `username` is a property in the component class.

2. Property Binding:

Property Binding is a technique to set values for properties of HTML elements or directives. It's a one-way data binding from the component to the view.

Key points:
- Syntax: [property]="expression"
- Direction: Component to view (one-way)
- Usage: Bind values to properties of HTML elements, components, or directives

Example:
```html
<img [src]="imageUrl">
```

Here, `imageUrl` is a property in the component class.

Main Differences:

1. Syntax:
   - String Interpolation: {{ }}
   - Property Binding: [ ]

2. Use cases:
   - String Interpolation is typically used for text content.
   - Property Binding is used for setting element properties, including non-string values.

3. Data type handling:
   - String Interpolation always results in a string.
   - Property Binding can work with various data types (strings, numbers, booleans, objects).

4. Expression evaluation:
   - String Interpolation can handle simple expressions and method calls that return a string.
   - Property Binding can handle more complex expressions and bind to any valid property.

5. HTML attribute vs DOM property:
   - String Interpolation sets the textContent of an element.
   - Property Binding sets actual properties of the DOM element.

Here's an example demonstrating both:

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-example',
  template: `
    <h1>{{ title }}</h1>
    <p [innerHTML]="content"></p>
    <button [disabled]="isDisabled">Click me</button>
  `
})
export class ExampleComponent {
  title = 'My App';
  content = '<strong>This is bold text</strong>';
  isDisabled = true;
}
```

In this example:
- `{{ title }}` uses String Interpolation to display the title.
- `[innerHTML]="content"` uses Property Binding to set the innerHTML property.
- `[disabled]="isDisabled"` uses Property Binding to set the disabled property of the button.
